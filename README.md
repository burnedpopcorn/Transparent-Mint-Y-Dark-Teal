Transparent Mint-Y-Dark-Teal

Made by burnedpopcorn180, this is a custom cinnamon theme built off of Mint-Y-Dark-Teal. Inspired by another custom theme, Faded-Dream, Mint-Y-Dark-Teal is now Transparent using some modifications by me.

(This theme was made only with PCs and the stock Linux Mint 21 look in mind, and hasn't been tested on anything else, So there might be non-transparent elements I missed accross different setups and settings.)

If you find anything seemingly out of place, or if you want to change anything about this theme, you can edit this theme to your liking, as I don't have much time to fix or change anything.

For instance, you can change the Teal color by editing cinnamon.css, and replacing every instance of hex color #1ba4b2 and #199ca8 (both are similar-looking Teal colors, used as accent colors) to a hex color you like.

:)
